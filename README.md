# The family gym

The family gym website is targeted towards families who want to go the gym together or separately using one family membership. The gym also provide child care for small children. The website provide information about the gym and an online form to become a member.

## Features
- Navigation

    The navigation is at the top of the page. To the left is the name of the gym and it links to the home page. To the right, "home" also links to the home page, "facilities" links to a gallery of pictures showing some of the gym's facilities, and "join" links to a form to become a family member.
- The About section

    The About section in the home page provide information about what is unique to the family gym so the users can immediately see if the gym is interesting for them.
- The footer

    The footer shows the gym's opening times and had also social media links.
- The gallery

    The gallery opens in a separate page and show the facilities and activities available at the gym.
- The form

    The form also open in a separate page and collects the family name, the size of the family and an email address and offers a family membership to the gym.

## Testing

- I tested the internal links between the pages and confirmed that they work.
- I tested that the form works correctly. In particular it checks if one enters a number (between 1 and 100) and that the email address has the correct format.
- I tested the responsiveness of the website for different screen sizes.

### Bugs

    One link did not work because I forgot to change the placeholder text to a link

### Validator testing

    No errors were found with the W3C validator for both html and css files.

### Accessibility

    The accessibility score for my code was 100% according to lighthouse in devtools.
